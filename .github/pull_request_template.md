- Is this changeset backwards compatible for existing clusters? Applying:
    - [ ] is completely transparent, will not impact the workload in any way.
    - [ ] requires running a migration script.
    - [ ] will create noticeable cluster degradation.
          E.g. logs or metrics are not being collected or Kubernetes API server
          will not be responding while upgrading.
    - [ ] requires draining and/or replacing nodes.
    - [ ] will change any APIs.
          E.g. removes or changes any CK8S config options or Kubernetes APIs.
    - [ ] will break the cluster.
          I.e. full cluster migration is required.
