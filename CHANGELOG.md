-------------------------------------------------
## v0.9.1 - 2020-12-10


-------------------------------------------------
## v0.9.0 - 2020-12-10

### Release notes

- The new default image is  now `ck8s-v1.18.12+ck8s1`.

### Added

- `extra_tags` support for AWS.
- Check if cloud provider is AWS so node name tests can be executed
- New version of Kubernetes supported: v1.18.12

-------------------------------------------------
## v0.8.0 - 2020-11-09


### Breaking changes

- DNS records must now be managed manually. For safespring and citycloud you must remove the terraform state for the DNS records before upgrading to this version.

### Release notes

- The new OIDC config variables can be added with a migration script for v0.8.0.

### Added

- Initial Azure support.
- Added new variables for the Kubernetes api server OIDC config.

### Removed

- Removed all DNS creation.
- Removed the `dns_prefix` config variable.

-------------------------------------------------
## v0.7.0 - 2020-10-15

### Fixed
- Support relative config path.

### Changed
- Upgrade jq to v1.6
- Upgrade ansible to 2.9.14
- Changed Terraform version to 0.12.29

### Added
- Option to specify disk size on exoscale nodes.
- Netaddr to list of requirements

-------------------------------------------------
## v0.6.0 - 2020-09-25

### Breaking changes

- The old Terraform variables configuration (config.tfvars) is no longer
  supported and needs to be updated to the new format (tfvars.json). However,
  once the configuration has been updated it can be applied without any change.
  See: [docs/migration/0.6.0.md#tfvars](docs/migration/0.6.0.md#tfvars)
- PSPs cannot be disabled anymore. The effect has to be achieved by creating a permissive policy.
  After an update to v0.6.0, it is required to edit the manifest for the static apiserver pods to enable the `PodSecurityPolicy` admission plugin.
- The old cluster configuration *(config.sh)* is no longer supported and needs to be updated to the new format *(config.yaml)*.
  However, once the configuration has been updated it can be applied without any change.
  See: [docs/migration/0.6.0.md#config](docs/migration/0.6.0.md#config)
- The old cluster secret configuration *(secrets.env)* is no longer supported and needs to be updated to the new format *(secrets.yaml)*.
  However, once the configuration has been updated it can be applied without any change.
  See: [docs/migration/0.6.0.md#secrets](docs/migration/0.6.0.md#secrets)

### Release notes

- The prod flavor is broken on Exoscale due to the machine disks being too small for the local volumes.
  You may configure smaller volumes than the default to work around this.
- The `ENABLE_PSP` value should be removed from the config, see breaking changes regarding PSPs.
- The static apiserver pod manifests should be edited to enable the `PodSecurityPolicy` admission plugin **after** the upgrade.
- When Kubernetes is installed it will be installed using the Kubelet version.
  This means that if your VM image has different versions of Kubeadm and
  Kubelet, the Kubelet version will be picked.

### Added

- Added prod flavor for production grade defaults.
- Command to add new machines.
- Support for cloning and replacing nodes but with a different image.
- Support for upgrading the Kubernetes control plane.
- Command to list available machine images.
- Image validation which checks if the Kubelet version is compatible with the
  current control plane version running in the cluster.
- New Exoscale, Safespring and Citycloud images:
  - ck8s-v1.15.12+ck8s0
  - ck8s-v1.16.14+ck8s0
  - ck8s-v1.17.11+ck8s0

### Fixed

- Bug where tfe provider do not read the configured value in backend_config.hcl
- Bug where folders where not created before uploading crds
- Missing join-cluster Ansible playbook path which caused node replacement and
  cloning to fail.
- The Terraform plan diff check to also include the case where a plan is being
  caused by data sources with depends_on but no actual change occured. This
  currently happens for the Exoscale provider.
- Interactive runs with SSH commands (e.g. kubeadm reset) not working properly
  due to stdin being blocked after the SSH session closed.
- Errors when cleaning up kubernetes on destroy is now handled properly
- Making sure to select an active master IP when joining a new node

### Changed

- Removed some default values to make this ready for open sourcing
- tfvars machines configuration so that name, node type, size and more are all
  grouped into a single object.
- tfvars configuration language from HCL to JSON.
- all commands that previously required node type as an argument no longer do,
  only node name is now needed (e.g. `drain master foo` -> `drain foo`).
- Citycloud: Api server white list is applied to api server loadbalancer now as well as the VMs.
- Increases timeout for api server loadbalancer to 10m
- Removed CRDs. These will be installed from the apps repository instead.
- Reduced local volume size for dev flavor.
- Reduced control plane node sizes on Safespring for dev flavor.
- Configuration files *(config.sh and secrets.env)* changed from *dotenv* format to *yaml*.
- Install Kubernetes using the Kubelet version.
- Bumped SOPS version to 3.6.1

-------------------------------------------------
## v0.5.0 - 2020-08-06

# Initial release

First release of the cluster installer for Compliant Kubernetes.

The cluster installer features a go cli that can create kubernetes clusters. It will both provision the necessary cloud infrastructure and install Kubernetes on top of the virtual machines. It is primarily intended for use in Compliant Kubernetes.
